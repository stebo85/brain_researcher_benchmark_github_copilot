# Analysis Results

This directory contains the results of all executed brain imaging analyses.

## Directory Structure

Each analysis run creates a timestamped directory:

```
results/
├── analysis_name_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
│   ├── results.md          # Complete analysis results and logs
│   └── [other files]       # Any additional output files
└── another_analysis_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
    └── results.md
```

## Results File Format

Each `results.md` file contains:

1. **Metadata**: Timestamp, analysis file, CVMFS path
2. **Analysis Prompt**: The original analysis request
3. **Execution Log**: Detailed logs of the execution process
4. **Container Information**: Details about containers used
5. **Command Outputs**: All outputs from executed commands
6. **Thought Process**: Automated documentation of the analysis workflow
7. **Error Messages**: Any errors or warnings encountered

## Usage

### Viewing Results

Simply navigate to the timestamped directory and open `results.md`:

```bash
cat results/example_analysis_20231214_120000/results.md
```

### Comparing Results

Compare results from different runs:

```bash
diff results/analysis_20231214_120000/results.md \
     results/analysis_20231214_130000/results.md
```

### Searching Results

Search across all results:

```bash
grep -r "error" results/
grep -r "success" results/
```

## Automated Generation

These results are automatically generated by the GitHub Actions workflow when:
- An analysis markdown file is pushed to the `analyses/` directory
- The workflow is manually triggered via GitHub Actions UI

## Retention

Results are committed to the repository and persist across workflow runs. To manage storage:

1. **Keep Important Results**: Preserve results from successful analyses
2. **Archive Old Results**: Move old results to an archive branch if needed
3. **Clean Up Test Runs**: Remove results from test/validation runs

## Interpreting Results

### Success Indicators

Look for these in the results:
- ✓ checkmarks indicating successful steps
- No error messages in execution logs
- Expected output files generated
- "Analysis completed" message at the end

### Failure Indicators

Watch for these:
- ⚠ warning symbols
- ✗ error symbols
- "failed" or "error" messages in logs
- Missing expected outputs

## Troubleshooting

If results are not as expected:

1. **Check Execution Log**: Review the detailed logs in the results file
2. **Verify Input**: Ensure the analysis prompt was correct
3. **Review Workflow Logs**: Check GitHub Actions logs for system-level errors
4. **Test Locally**: Verify commands work in your local environment
5. **Check Container**: Ensure the requested container is available in Neurodesk

## Contributing

When sharing results:
- Include the complete results directory

## Privacy and Data

**Important**: Results may contain sensitive data from your analyses. Ensure:
- No personally identifiable information (PII) is included
- Data sharing complies with relevant regulations (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.)
- Sensitive results are stored in private repositories

## Support
